	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm based on the number of operations it performs as the input size increases. An efficient algorithm runs in the least possible time for a given input.</p>
	 <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It is denoted as O(n), where n represents the input size. Optimizing Space Complexity ensures that an algorithm uses minimal memory while maintaining performance.</p>
